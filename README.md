## CAF top level project
 
This repository provides a consistent snapshot of all the other CAF sub-projects. They are tested together to create an implicit CAF release that is enforced with `npm shrinkwrap`.  

Most users of CAF will just clone this repository and update submodules recursively, i.e.:

      git submodule update --init
